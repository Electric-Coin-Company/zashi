## Sending Disclosures

In the case where we become aware of security issues affecting other projects
that have never affected Zcash, our intention is to inform those projects of
security issues on a best effort basis.

In the case where we fix a security issue in the Zashi wallet(s) that also
affect the following neighboring projects, our intention is to engage in
responsible disclosures with them as described in
https://github.com/RD-Crypto-Spec/Responsible-Disclosure.

## Bilateral Responsible Disclosure Agreements

We have set up agreements with the following neighboring projects to share
vulnerability information.

Specifically, we have agreed to engage in responsible disclosures for security
issues affecting this repository and others we maintain for the same platform
with the following contacts:
